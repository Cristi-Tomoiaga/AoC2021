# AoC2021

My personal solutions to the [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021/) puzzles using Python 3.10.0

Each day has a folder with the code (in general[^1] `main.py`) and the test input from the problem statement.
The source code contains either both parts independent or the final solution for part 2.

## Testing the solutions

1. Make sure you have Python 3.10.0 installed on your machine
2. Create a new file called `input.txt` in that folder and copy your personal input there
3. Run `main.py`

[^1]: I will update this if needed
